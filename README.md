# Corazon-Heart
Corazon is an open-source C# library which aims to make your development life easier. It includes libraries to customize your website language, integer obfuscation, cryptography and more.

The codes are still experimental. I am trying to combine some codes which I have written and we can see where this will lead to. Feel free to use the codes for any purpose - commercial / non-commercial alike.

Want to work together in this or have any thought? Let me know at kennydanani@gmail.com!
